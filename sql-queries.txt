Working queries:
TYPE: Visibility 
1. How many machines are present in my environment?
SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT mid) as machine_count FROM machine

2. Which machines have name starting with aks?
SQL: SELECT hostname FROM machine WHERE hostname LIKE 'aks%' LIMIT 1024;

3. Which 5 processes have longest names? 
SQL: SELECT EXE_PATH, LENGTH(EXE_PATH) as name_length FROM process WHERE EXE_PATH IS NOT NULL ORDER BY name_length DESC LIMIT 5

4. What % of machines are running on Windows OS?
SQL: 100% of machines are running on Windows OS.

5. Which Windows machine does not have windefend.exe running?
SQL: SELECT m.hostname FROM machine m JOIN process p ON m.mid = p.mid WHERE m.os = 'Windows' AND p.EXE_PATH NOT LIKE '%windefend.exe%' GROUP BY m.hostname

6. What is the IP address of machine aksnpwin2000002?
SQL: Can't generate SQL because IP address column is not present

7. What is the OS type of machine aksnpwin2000002?
SQL: SELECT os FROM machine WHERE hostname = 'aksnpwin2000002' LIMIT 1;



TYPE: Insights
1. Which 5 machines have reported least number of processes? 
SQL: SELECT m.hostname, COUNT(p.pid) as process_count FROM machine m JOIN process p ON m.mid = p.mid GROUP BY m.hostname ORDER BY process_count ASC LIMIT 5

2. How many machines have powershell running?
SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.mid) FROM process p JOIN cmdline c ON p.cmdline_hash = c.cmdline_hash WHERE c.cmdline LIKE '%powershell%';




These queries didn't lead to perfect answers initially:

1. Which machine has reported most number of processes?

Before tweaking the prompt to indicate pids can be unique:
SQL: SELECT machine.mid, machine.hostname, COUNT(process.pid) as process_count FROM machine JOIN process ON machine.mid = process.mid GROUP BY machine.mid, machine.hostname ORDER BY process_count DESC LIMIT 1

After tweaking the prompt to indicate pids are not unique and can have duplicates:
SQL: SELECT m.hostname, COUNT(p.pid_hash) as process_count FROM machine m JOIN process p ON m.mid = p.mid GROUP BY m.hostname ORDER BY process_count DESC LIMIT 1

2. Create chart for count of machines running powershell vs machines not running powershell

Sometimes this question led to the SQL query which counted the processes (instead of machines running the processes):
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM process WHERE LOWER(EXE_PATH) LIKE '%powershell%';

Othertimes it worked perfectly:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.mid) as powershell_count FROM process p JOIN machine m ON p.mid = m.mid WHERE p.EXE_PATH LIKE '%powershell.exe%'

3. Count of machines running powershell vs machines not running powershell

This query didn't work most of the times. It counted processes or commandlines, and not machines.
